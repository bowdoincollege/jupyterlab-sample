# JupyterLab Sample

This is a sample repository for use demonstrating JupyterLab and
git/GitHub integration.

1. In JupyterLab, clone this repository
2. Make changes, add files, etc..
3. Add changed and added files to git.
4. Commit changes to git.
5. Push committed changes to GitHub.

If working in a team, before you start a work session, make sure you *pull any changes* from GitHub before making more changes. If you don't you may end up with a *merge conflict* and that's not fun.
